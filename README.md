# Smart HR Assistant (Smart-HR-Assistant)

AI-powered Resume Analysis & ATS Score Evaluation Tool

Smart HR Assistant is a full-stack web application that helps job seekers analyze their resumes against a target job description. It provides structured insights and an ATS (Applicant Tracking System) score using a FastAPI backend and a React frontend.

## Features

- Resume analysis: extract skills, keywords and assess content match to a job description.
- ATS scoring: compute an ATS-style score and highlight missing keywords.
- Simple, API-driven frontend for upload and results display.

## Architecture overview

1. User uploads a PDF resume and supplies a job description on the frontend.
2. Frontend sends two POST requests to the backend:
   - `/analyse_resume/` → returns structured analysis JSON.
   - `/score_resume/` → returns ATS score.
3. Frontend navigates to the Analysis page and displays results returned by the backend.

## Backend (FastAPI)

Location: `main.py`

### Endpoints

- `POST /analyse_resume/`

  - Form fields: `resume_file` (file), `job_description` (string).
  - Action: saves the uploaded PDF into `temp_uploads/` and calls `models.resume_analyser.Analyser.analyse_resume()`.
  - Response: JSON `{ "analysis": <object> }`.

- `POST /score_resume/`
  - Form fields: same as `/analyse_resume/`.
  - Action: saves file and calls `models.ats_score.ResumeScorer.score_resume()`.
  - Response: JSON `{ "ats_score": <number> }`.

### Running locally (backend)

PowerShell example:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Frontend (React)

Location: `src/`

### Running locally (frontend)

PowerShell example:

```powershell
npm install
npm start
```

The frontend is typically available at `http://localhost:3000/`.

### Notes about integration

- The frontend posts multipart/form-data to `http://localhost:8000/analyse_resume/` and `/score_resume/` (see `src/pages/home.js`).
- If backend is hosted elsewhere, update the URLs or move them to configuration.
- Configure CORS in FastAPI when serving frontend from a different origin.

## API examples

PowerShell curl examples:

```powershell
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/analyse_resume/" -F "resume_file=@C:\path\to\resume.pdf" -F "job_description=Data Scientist"

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/score_resume/" -F "resume_file=@C:\path\to\resume.pdf" -F "job_description=Data Scientist"
```

Don’t rely on filenames provided by users; instead, sanitize them or create unique server-side names (e.g., UUIDs).

Set up CORS controls, authentication, rate limits, and maximum request sizes before exposing the service publicly.

Use HTTPS in production environments. Favor temporary storage for user uploads and ensure automatic cleanup processes are in place.

If any analysis step is computationally expensive or slow, offload it to background jobs and report progress through polling or WebSocket updates.

## Troubleshooting

- "Failed to contact the analysis service": verify the FastAPI server is running and accessible at the configured URL (default `http://localhost:8000/`).
- 500 server errors: check the uvicorn console for tracebacks and ensure Python dependencies and model files are present.
- File size: frontend blocks >5 MB by default; adjust client and server limits if needed.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository and create a branch.
2. Add tests and documentation updates where relevant.
3. Open a pull request with a clear description of changes.

## Next steps / TODOs

- Move API base URL to an environment/config variable in the frontend.
- Add server-side filename sanitization and cleanup for `temp_uploads/`.
- Improve UX for long-running analysis (progress indicator, background jobs).
- Add unit and integration tests for `models/` and API endpoints.
